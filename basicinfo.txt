Hi, I'm Jordan Alexandria. I was born and raised in Southern California. As much as I love going to the beach, the wooded hills of a little town called, Redding, California has captured my heart. I have lived in Redding for three years and plan to stay here for the next thirty!</p>
 am passionate about connecting with people through the world of technology. 
We live in an age, where technology has become a bridge into the lives of those who would otherwise be strangers, and has turned them into friends.
Everyday I am learning a new skill, taking what was once a dream into a reality. I am just scratching the surface of design, web development and computer science.</p>
I have become fascinated with the endless possibilities of creating an entire atmosphere for people to step into. 
Programming changes that way I communicate with people, because I'm not just talking about my ideas, I'm showing them.</p>
About three years ago, I was starting my first year at Bethel School of Ministry and during that time, Bethel School of Technology Powered by WozU (Steve Wozniak | Co-Founder of Apple ) was launched. 
For the next few years I sat on the idea of going into Technology.
It wasnt until the Summer of 2019, that I finally took the leap into programming and by October that same year, I was enrolled to BST as a Full Stack Web Student.</p>
I would consider myself an amazing asset to any team becauase I absolutely love what I do and adapt well to new languages and systems. I love what I do because of the impact I am able to make on the next generation.</p>
